    <h2>about me</h2>

    <p>I love stories! I've been telling stories since before I could even write. I dictated my first published story to my kindergarten teacher, Ms. Connors, who typed it on a typewriter. I moved on to adventure and fantasy stories in grade school and now write picture books. I love walking through nature, kayaking, hiking, singing, rainbow spotting and eating chocolate. </p>

    <p>I am the author of the forthcoming picture book INSIDE THIS APPLE, to be illustrated by <a href="http://www.marylundquist.com" target="_blank">Mary Lundquist</a> (Bloomsbury, 2019). I am the recipient of grants from the Minnesota State Arts Board, the Metro Regional Arts Council, and The Jerome Foundation, as well as a 2012 Loft Shabo Picture Book Award and a Pushcart nomination. I earned my MFA in fiction from Hamline University and have taught children's literature in the public schools and at the undergraduate level for nearly two decades. </p>
  <p>
        In addition to writing and teaching, I am dedicated to promoting and supporting the writing community. I have interviewed children's authors for Write On!, a program on KFAI Radio. I  regularly develop community programming related to children's literature. Originally from Minnesota, I now live in sunny San Antonio, TX, where I host The Picture Book Salon of San Antonio. </p>

<p>For years I have taught writing and stories. Now I get to write my own stories all the time!
