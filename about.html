<h2>Section 1</h2>

<p>Charlotte Sullivan Wild has been telling stories since before she could even write. She dictated her first published story to her kindergarten teacher, Ms. Connors, who typed it on a typewriter. She moved on adventure and fantasy stories in grade school and now writes picture books. She loves walking through nature, kyaking, hiking, singing, rainbow spotting and eating chocolate. For many years she taught writing and stories in school. Now she gets to write her own stories all the time.</p>
