      <h2>the writing community</h2>

      <p>Stories are most delicious when shared - at bedtime, on the playground, at work, or curled up in a quiet corner with hot cocoa. The process of telling stories is no different. It takes a village!</p>

<p>I could never do what I do as an artist without the patience, feedback, kind encouragement, and lively discussions with fellow artists. When I first dreamt of being a writer, I had no idea that dream would lead me to one of the kindest and most engaged communities around.</p>

<p>I have been a part of two wonderful writing communities, one in Texas and one in Minnesota. Here are some of the great community programs in Texas, Minnesota and beyond. </p>

<p>Welcome to our village. Enjoy conversations about the world of children's books and making art. Find a place to connect with other writers. Be inspired to build community where you are. Most of all, welcome. I'm glad you're here.
</p>
