    <h2>about me</h2>


    <p>I am the author of the forthcoming picture book INSIDE THIS APPLE, to be illustrated by <a href="http://www.marylundquist.com" target="_blank">Mary Lundquist</a> (Bloomsbury, 2019). I am the recipient of grants from the Minnesota State Arts Board, the Metro Regional Arts Council, and The Jerome Foundation, as well as a 2012 Loft Shabo Picture Book Award and a Pushcart nomination. I earned my MFA in fiction from Hamline University and have taught children's literature in the public schools and at the undergraduate level for nearly two decades. </p>
  <p>
        In addition to writing and teaching, I am dedicated to promoting and supporting the writing community. I have interviewed children's authors for Write On!, a program on KFAI Radio. I  regularly develop community programming related to children's literature. Originally from Minnesota, I now live in sunny San Antonio, TX, where I host <a href="events.html">The Picture Book Salon of San Antonio</a>. </p>

<p>I've been telling stories since before I could write. I dictated my first published story (about my great grandpa) to my kindergarten teacher, Ms. Connors, who typed it on a typewriter.</p>

<p>In third grade I won a writing contest for a story called "The Shapable Rainbow." I was pretty sure I'd invented the word "shapable." In the story a wild rainbow, changing shapes, got stuck in my climbing tree. I caught it and then used the colors to make whatever I needed: water for the wading pool, a colorful towel, and bright fruit for a snack. But when the rainbow started to slow and fade, I realized what I had to do: let it go. </p>

<p>I won $25! That was a lot for a kid in 1983! I went on to win several Iowa Reading Council contests. This made me even more excited about writing stories. But to be honest? I would have loved making up tales about enchanted islands or grumpy neighbors even without the contests.

    <p>I spent most Sunday afternoons stretched out with the comics, illustrated classics, or Nancy Drew books under our sunny living room window. Here I'm wearing my Laura Ingalls Wilder dress, circa 1985, 5th grade.</p>


<p>I've always loved stories! Now I get to write my own stories all the time!
